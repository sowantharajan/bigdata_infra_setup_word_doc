If you are using MacOS, then you can install Homebrew package manager and run following commands from terminal:-

To install Java (Prerequisite for Kafka), run

brew install openjdk@11
To install Kafka, run

$ brew install kafka
Here are the brew logs of Kafka Installation, Note that brew also installs Zookeeper as Kafka dependency:-

********************************************************************************************************* 
==> Installing kafka dependency: zookeeper
==> Pouring zookeeper--3.7.0.catalina.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
To have launchd start zookeeper now and restart at login:
  brew services start zookeeper
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  zkServer start
==> Summary

********************************************************************************************************* 
  
  
Edit the server.properties file

$ vim /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties
Looks like default server.properties is not valid for this version kafka.
It works after changing like below:

Uncomment the listeners property and update the value from
listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092
to
listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092


Note: If you want separate folder for logs and zookeeper data then change it like in the actual document 
[sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/var/run/zookeeper/data
sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/var/run/zookeeper/data

mkdir -p /usr/local/var/lib/kafka-logs
sudo chmod 777 /usr/local/var/lib/kafka-logs
/usr/local/Cellar/kafka/2.1.0/libexec/bin/kafka-server-start.sh /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties]

Start Zookeeper in new terminal using:

$ zookeeper-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties
Start Kafka in new terminal using:

$ kafka-server-start /usr/local/etc/kafka/server.properties

Additional steps(If you want):
Setting the Path:
To run Kafka from anywhere, use the following steps to set the path:

Step1: Move into the bin folder of . Open the '.bash_profile' file by using the command: 'nano ~/.bash_profile'.

Step2: The '.bash_profile' file will open. Go to the end and set the path as:

export PATH:"$PATH:/<forepath_directory>/<kafka_directory>/bin"  
Note: To know the forepath directory, use 'pwd' command. It will display its name.
Step3: After setting the path, apply 'kafka-' or 'kafka-topics.sh' command to know whether the path is successfully set.

Using Brew
If the mac users have Brew installed, they can use it for Kafka installation.

There are following steps used to install Apache Kafka using brew:

Step1: Use 'brew install kafka' and press enter key to install Kafka. Wait a while, and Kafka will be installed on the system. To test, use any kafka command.

Step2: If the 'kafka-' command is used, it will show files with and without '.sh' extension files. It is because the bin path is set in the '.bash_profile' file. So, edit the file again and remove that line from the end. Save, and exit.

Step3: Again use the command 'kafka-', now the files without '.sh' will appear.

Step4; But, to use kafka commands, the user needs to visit the kafka_directory always.

So, this is another way to install Apache Kafka on the system.
